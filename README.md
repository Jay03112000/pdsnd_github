### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Exploration with Git and Version Control

### Description
This project is part of Udacity’s *Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree*.  
It demonstrates how to use **Git** and **GitHub** for version control in a realistic workflow.  
In this project, I practiced:
- Forking and cloning a repository  
- Creating branches (`documentation` and `refactoring`)  
- Updating documentation (README and code comments)  
- Refactoring Python code (`bikeshare.py`)  
- Merging branches back to the main repository

The goal is to simulate how professional developers manage code versions, documentation, and collaboration using Git.

### Files used
- **bikeshare.py** – main Python program for bikeshare data analysis  
- **new_york_city.csv** – dataset (excluded using `.gitignore`)  
- **.gitignore** – file to exclude data files and temporary files  
- **README.md** – documentation describing the project, files, and workflow

## How to Run the Project
- To run the project, open a terminal and execute 
bash
python bikeshare.py
